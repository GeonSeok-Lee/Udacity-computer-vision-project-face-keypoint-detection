# Project Title

face keypoint detection with deep-learning.

## Description

This project will be all about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of face.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Pytorch, OpenCV, pandas, etc. needed before installing program.

### Coming soon

* Now, I'm working on project
* needed to obey 'hornor code of Udacity'
